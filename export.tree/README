The MEG files contain a channel with triggers necessary for event marking and timing. Separate event files with onsets are provided in the participant directories for completeness only; the MEG triggers should be used for actual onsets in analysis. The delay between the trigger and the visual onset of an on-screen event sent by the projector is approximately 20 ms, as estimated using a photodiode.
